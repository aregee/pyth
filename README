========================================
pyth - Python text markup and conversion
========================================

Pyth is intended to make it easy to convert marked-up text between different common formats.

*Marked-up text* means text which has:

* Paragraphs
* Headings
* Bold, italic, and underlined text
* Hyperlinks
* Bullet lists
* Simple tables
* Very little else


Formats I initially want to support are:

* xhtml
* rtf
* pdf (output)


These three formats cover web, Word / OpenOffice, and print. 


Design principles
=================

* Ignore unsupported information in input formats (e.g. page layout)
* Ignore font issues -- output in a single font.
* Ignore specific text sizes, but maintain italics, boldface, subscript/superscript
* Have no dependencies unless they are written in Python, and work
* Make it easy to add support for new formats, by using an architecture based on *plugins* and *adapters*.



Examples
========

See http://github.com/brendonh/pyth/tree/master/examples/


Unit tests
==========

The sources contains some unit tests (written using python unittest
module) in the 'tests' directory.

To run the tests we can either run them individually as python script,
either use `python nose`_.  If using nose then we just need to go into
the tests directory and invoke nosetest from there (make sure that
pyth module is in PYTHONPATH).

.. _python nose: http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/


Python 3 migration
==================

The code was originally written for Python 2.
It has been upgraded to Python 3 compatibility via 'modernize'.
This does not mean it will actually work!

pyth.plugins.rtf15.reader has been debugged and now appears to work correctly.
pyth.plugins.xhtml.writer has been debugged and now appears to work correctly.
pyth.plugins.plaintext.writer has been debugged and now appears to work correctly.
Everything else: unknown!
See directory py3migration for a bit more detail.
(If you find something is broken that worked before, please
either fix it or stick to pyth version 0.6.0.)


Limitations
===========

pyth.plugins.rtf15.reader:
- bulleted or enumerated items will be returned
  as plain paragraphs (no indentation, no bullets).
- cannot cope with Symbol font correctly:
  - from MS Word: lower-coderange characters (greek mostly) work
  - from MS Word: higher-coderange characters are missing, because
    Word encodes them in a horribly complicated manner not supported
    by pyth currently
  - from Wordpad: lower- and higher-coderange characters come out in
    the wrong encoding (ANSI, I think)

Other: (to be documented)
